Mandelbrot definitions
f(z) = z^2 + c
...
f(z_n) = z_n-1^2 + c

The Mandelbrot set consists of all of those (complex) c-values for which the corresponding orbit of 0 under x2 + c does not escape to infinity.

Iterator cheat-sheet:
iter(), which iterates over &T.
iter_mut(), which iterates over &mut T.
into_iter(), which iterates over T.
